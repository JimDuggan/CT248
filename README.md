# CT248
Repo to support updated module Introduction to Modelling (CT248), which now uses Python instead of MATLAB.

My main expertise to date is in using R for data science, so I'm looking forward to the opportunity to learning some new skills, and also comparing and contrasting how you can achieve the similar outcomes with both languages. 

Here are some of my R resources:

* [Exploring Operations Research with R](https://github.com/JimDuggan/explore_or), my 2024 textbook (CRC Press) on R, and its application to the field of operations research.

* [System Dynamics Modelling with R](https://github.com/JimDuggan/SDMR), my 2016 textbook (Springer) on how you can combine system dynamics modelling with R.

There are three main parts to this course:

* First, we introduce [Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/), its data structures, the use of functions, and the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) package, which provides support for manipulating matrices.

* Next, we show how ordinary differential equations can be implemented using [SciPy](https://scipy.org), and focus on a number of interesting models, including exponential growth and decline, logistic growth, and diffusion processes.

* Finally, using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html), we introduce exploratory data analysis for a variety of data sets, and also explore a range of statistical methods including correlation and linear regression modelling.


There are a number of books used as reference material, including:

* ["Python for Data Analysis, 3rd Edition"](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book) by Wes McKinney, published by O'Reilly Media.
